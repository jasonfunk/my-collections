### `.github/workflows/`
GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow definitions. Three files:

| File | Trigger | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `ci.yml` | PR to `main` or `develop` | Runs lint and tests in parallel. Both must pass before a PR can merge. |
| `build.yml` | Push to `main` (i.e., after a merge) | Verifies the full monorepo builds successfully after every merge. |
| `audit.yml` | PR + weekly Monday schedule | Runs `npm audit --audit-level=critical --omit=dev`. Fails only on critical-severity vulnerabilities in non-dev dependencies. |

### `.git/`
Created by `git init`. Contains the entire version history of the project. Never edit this manually.

### `.gitignore`
Tells git which files and folders to never track. Key exclusions: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `.env` files, IDE folders, and Expo build artifacts.

### `.nvmrc`
Specifies the Node.js version for this project (`24`). Used by [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) — running `nvm use` in the project directory switches Node to the declared version automatically.

### `CLAUDE.md`
Instructions for Claude Code when working in this repository. Contains the tech stack, collaboration approach, development commands, and references to key documentation. **This file guides AI-assisted development sessions.**

### `package.json`
The monorepo root package file. Declares npm workspaces (`packages/*`) so a single `npm install` from this directory installs dependencies for all four packages. Also delegates `dev`, `build`, `lint`, and `test` scripts to Turborepo.

### `tsconfig.base.json`
Base TypeScript configuration extended by every package. Ensures consistent compiler settings (strict mode, ES2020 target, source maps, etc.) across the whole project without repeating them in each package.

### `turbo.json`
Turborepo pipeline configuration. Defines how tasks (`build`, `dev`, `lint`, `test`) relate to each other across packages. The critical rule: `build` depends on `^build`, meaning Turborepo always builds a package's dependencies before it — so `shared` is compiled before `api`, `web`, and `mobile`.

## `packages/shared/` — @my-collections/shared

```
packages/shared/
├── src/
│   ├── index.ts
│   └── types/
│       ├── common.ts
│       ├── star-wars.ts
│       ├── transformers.ts

├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

**Purpose:** The single source of truth for TypeScript types used across the entire project. The API, web app, and mobile app all import from this package. Defining types here once prevents them from drifting out of sync across packages.

**Build output:** Compiles to `dist/` (TypeScript → JavaScript + `.d.ts` declaration files). Other packages import the compiled output.

### `src/index.ts`
The public API of the package. Re-exports everything from the `types/` files. Consumers write `import { CollectionItem } from '@my-collections/shared'` — they never import from sub-paths.

### `src/types/common.ts`
Base types shared across all collections:
- `CollectionItem` — base interface every collection item type extends. Contains fields all items share: `id`, `name`, `condition`, `isOwned`, `acquisitionSource`, `estimatedValue`, `photoUrls`, etc.
- `ConditionGrade` — enum of collector condition grades (C10 = Mint down to C4 = Poor)
- `PackagingCondition` — condition of original box/card/packaging (separate from item condition)
- `AcquisitionSource` — how the item was obtained (eBay, flea market, original childhood toy, etc.)
- `CollectionType` — enum identifying which collection an item belongs to (STAR_WARS, TRANSFORMERS, HE_MAN)

### `src/types/star-wars.ts`
Types specific to original Kenner Star Wars figures (1977–1985):
- `StarWarsFigure` — extends `CollectionItem`; adds `line` (which product line), `figureSize`, `isCarded`, `cardbackStyle`, variant tracking, accessories list vs owned accessories list
- `StarWarsLine` — enum of product lines (Star Wars, ESB, ROTJ, POTF)
- `CardbackStyle` — enum of cardback variations (12-back through POTF) important for variant collectors
- `FigureSize` — 3¾ inch, 12-inch, or mini

### `src/types/transformers.ts`
Types specific to Generation 1 Transformers (1984–1990):
- `G1Transformer` — extends `CollectionItem`; adds `faction` (Autobot/Decepticon), `line` (series year), `altMode` (what it transforms into), `isCombiner`, `combinerTeam`, `hasTechSpec`, `rubSign`, etc.
- `TransformersFaction`, `TransformersLine`, `TransformerSize` — supporting enums

### `src/types/he-man.ts`
Types specific to Masters of the Universe figures (1981–1988):
- `MastersOfTheUniverseFigure` — extends `CollectionItem`; adds `characterType` (heroic/evil), `miniComic`, variant tracking, `hasArmorOrFeature` for action features
- `MastersLine` — original line, Princess of Power, mini figures
- `MastersCharacterType` — heroic warrior, evil warrior, etc.

## `packages/api/` — @my-collections/api

```
packages/api/
├── src/
│   ├── main.ts
│   ├── app.module.ts
│   ├── modules/        ← feature modules go here
│   ├── common/         ← shared guards, interceptors, pipes
│   └── config/         ← configuration logic
├── .env.example
├── nest-cli.json
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

**Purpose:** The NestJS REST API. Handles business logic, database access (PostgreSQL via TypeORM), authentication (OAuth2), and serves data to both the web app and mobile app.

**Runs on:** `http://localhost:3000` (dev). Swagger UI available at `/api/docs`.

**Framework pattern:** NestJS organizes code into *modules*. Each feature area (collections, auth, users) gets its own module folder under `src/modules/`. Each module contains a controller (handles HTTP requests), a service (business logic), and entities (database table definitions). This is the same pattern as Spring MVC controllers/services/repositories or ASP.NET Core controllers/services.

### `src/main.ts`
Application entry point. Bootstraps the NestJS app, registers global middleware (validation pipe, CORS), and sets up Swagger documentation. The `bootstrap()` function is equivalent to `public static void main()` in Java or `Program.cs` in C#.

### `src/app.module.ts`
Root module — the top of the dependency injection tree. All feature modules are imported here. `ConfigModule.forRoot({ isGlobal: true })` makes environment variables accessible throughout the app without re-importing in every module.

### `src/modules/`
Empty — feature modules will be added here as the app is built. Each feature gets its own subdirectory, e.g.:
- `src/modules/collections/` — CRUD for collection items
- `src/modules/auth/` — OAuth2 authentication
- `src/modules/users/` — user management

### `src/common/`
Shared cross-cutting code: guards (authorization checks), interceptors (request/response transforms), pipes (input validation). Not yet populated.

### `src/config/`
Configuration loading and validation logic. Not yet populated.

### `.env.example`
Template showing which environment variables the API needs. Copy this to `.env` (which is git-ignored) and fill in real values:
```
PORT=3000
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/my_collections
JWT_SECRET=...
OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=...
OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=...
```

### `nest-cli.json`
Configuration for the NestJS CLI tool (`@nestjs/cli`). Tells the CLI where source files live and how to compile. The CLI provides code generation commands (e.g., `nest generate module collections`).

### `tsconfig.json`
Extends `../../tsconfig.base.json`. Adds NestJS-specific settings: `"emitDecoratorMetadata": true` and `"experimentalDecorators": true` — required for NestJS decorators (`@Controller()`, `@Injectable()`, etc.) to work at runtime. Also overrides `module` to `CommonJS` since Node.js uses CommonJS modules.

├── index.html
├── package.json
├── tsconfig.json
└── vite.config.ts
```

**Purpose:** The React single-page application. Compiles to static files (`dist/`) that are uploaded to Dreamhost shared hosting.

**Runs on:** `http://localhost:5173` (dev server).

### `index.html`
The one and only HTML file for the entire app. The browser loads this file; React then takes over and renders everything else dynamically. The `<div id="root">` is where React mounts.

### `src/main.tsx`
JavaScript entry point (`.tsx` = TypeScript + JSX). Mounts the React app into the DOM, wrapped in:
- `StrictMode` — enables extra React warnings in development to catch potential issues early
- `BrowserRouter` — enables client-side routing (URL changes without full page reloads)

### `src/App.tsx`
Root React component. Defines the top-level route structure using React Router v6. New pages are added as `<Route>` elements here.

### `src/components/`
Reusable UI components that appear on multiple pages — buttons, cards, modals, form fields, etc. Each component in its own file.

### `src/pages/`
Page-level components — one per route/screen. These are the "views" that `App.tsx` routes to. They compose smaller components from `src/components/`.

### `src/hooks/`
Custom React hooks — reusable stateful logic extracted from components. Example: `useCollectionItems()` that fetches and caches collection data.

### `src/services/`
Functions that call the API. Keeps HTTP request logic out of components and hooks. Example: `collectionsService.ts` with `getItems()`, `createItem()`, etc.

### `src/store/`
Global application state. Will hold auth state, collection data cache, UI state, etc. Technology TBD (React Context, Zustand, or Redux).

### `vite.config.ts`
Vite build and dev server configuration. Key setting: the `/api` proxy forwards requests to `http://localhost:3000` during development so the web app can call the API without CORS issues.

### `tsconfig.json`
Extends `../../tsconfig.base.json`. Adds `"lib": ["DOM", "DOM.Iterable"]` (browser APIs) and `"jsx": "react-jsx"` (React JSX transform). Sets `"noEmit": true` because Vite handles compilation — TypeScript is only used for type checking.

## `packages/mobile/` — @my-collections/mobile

```
packages/mobile/
├── src/
│   ├── screens/
│   │   └── HomeScreen.tsx
│   ├── components/     ← reusable UI components
│   ├── navigation/     ← navigation config

└── tsconfig.json
```

**Purpose:** The Expo/React Native mobile app. Shares types with the API and web app via `@my-collections/shared`. Targets Android first, iOS second from a single codebase.

**Runs via:** `expo start` (opens Expo Go or connects to an emulator).

### `app.json`
Expo project configuration. Defines:
- App name, version, icon, and splash screen
- Bundle identifiers (`com.mycollections.app`) used to identify the app in app stores
- **Plugins** — declares which native device capabilities the app uses:
  - `expo-camera` — camera access
  - `expo-barcode-scanner` — barcode/QR scanning
  - `expo-notifications` — push notifications

### `src/screens/`
One component per app screen. Screens are what navigation moves between. `HomeScreen.tsx` is the placeholder dashboard.

### `src/components/`
Reusable React Native UI components shared across multiple screens.

### `src/navigation/`
Navigation configuration — defines the app's tab structure, stack navigators, and deep link handling. Will use Expo Router (file-based routing) or React Navigation.

### `src/hooks/`
Custom hooks for device features and shared logic — e.g., `useCamera()`, `useBarcodeScanner()`.

### `src/services/`
API call functions — same pattern as the web app's `src/services/`. Shared logic may eventually move to `packages/shared/`.

### `tsconfig.json`
Extends Expo's base TypeScript config (`expo/tsconfig.base`). Adds a `paths` alias so `@my-collections/shared` resolves directly to the shared package source during development.
